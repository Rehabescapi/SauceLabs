Hi There. 
I used Cypress because I wanted to explore the newer version of this testing framework.

Tests are located in cypress/integration

I only started having problems in the total_price file area.

 **Installation **
 npm install 

To run tests with a single command 
type 'npm run test'
This runs all the tests headless.


To use the cypress engine run 'npm run cypress' and then select which test suite you want to use.
The "Run # integration test" is a bit finicy and won't do as requested.
